### Google Maps API:
The App can show a map with the general position of a criminal's birth country. In order to use the app properly, a Google Maps API-Key has to be saved to your local properties.
In order to do this, you open the file local.properties in the package Gradle Scripts. There you add the property
MAPS_API_KEY= _YOUR_API_KEY_

You can get your own API-Key from Google developers Maps API for free.
